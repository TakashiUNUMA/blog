<span class="code-pl-input">man Takashi Unuma</span><br><span class="code-pl-output">Dr. Takashi Unuma is currently working at the Office of Meteorological Analysis and Application Development, Atmosphere and Ocean Department of Japan Meteorological Agency. Since 2018, he has joined one of the groups of developing a high-resolution rainfall product, and is now working on precipitation intensity of the product to improve its quality by applying a new signal processing method to dual-pol radar data.</span><br><span class="code-pl-output">He has investigated rainfall characteristics of two heavy rainfall events and found that the contribution from stronger rains due to organized systems with areas of 200 km^2 plays a major role in regions with significant amounts of rainfall during the heavy rainfall events (Unuma and Takemi 2021). He has also assisted to investigate environmental factors of the typical heavy rain events occurred over the eastern part of Japan in September 2019 (Takemi and Unuma 2020), and over the western parts of Japan in July 2018 (Takemi and Unuma 2019) in recent years.</span><br><span class="code-pl-output">During 2016-2017, he was working in Tsu local meteorological office and found an aggregating process for rainfall-area convergence over a small-scale concave terrain over the central part of Japan.</span><br><span class="code-pl-output">In 2015, he was working at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University under the research project of CECAR-Africa. In this project, he has developed a regional forecasting system over the west Africa by using WRF model and WRFDA systems.</span><br><span class="code-pl-output">During master and Ph.D courses, his research topic was slow-moving or quasi-stationary convective clusters associated with heavy rainfalls over Japan. He finally found key environmental conditions for the development of slow-moving or quasi-stationary convective clusters during the warm season in Japan (Unuma and Takemi, 2016a, b) and then has received his Ph.D from Kyoto University in 2017.</span><br><span class="code-pl-output">Although environmental conditions, i.e. Vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and horizontal wind speed, vary with the climate region, an understanding of disaster spawning convective systems is extremely important for our society not only in Japan but all over the world. To prevent such disasters, I want to find some key processes of the convective systems using the state-of-the-art observational data. Studying the key processes from the meteorological insight, I want to give the knowledge back to our society in order to reduce meteorological disaster. </span><br><br></div></div></div></div></header><div id="content-outer"><div id="content-inner"></div></div><footer><div id="footer-inner"><div class="social-icons"><a class="social-icon" href="https://github.com/TakashiUNUMA" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a><a class="social-icon" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/takashiunuma/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a><a class="social-icon" href="https://twitter.com/UNUSB" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a><a class="social-icon" href="https://www.instagram.com/unusb/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></div><p class="design-info">Powered by <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank">Hexo</a> | Theme <a href="https://github.com/lazysheep666/terminal_theme" target="_blank">Teminal</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Tonny-Gu/terminal_theme" target="_blank">NekoDaemon Remix</a>)</p><p class="design-info"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a>
